Yeah,I dont know what to insert here.Nothing special about me.Let's talk about my favorite anime characters then.
<div class="anime">
<h2 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline;">SPOILERS!!!</h2><br>
<div class="itachi flex">
<img src="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/378/859934-god2vj0xj3.jpg"></img>
<p style="font-size:16px;">This guy,Itachi Uchiha,deserves the No.1 spot on this list.He is the literal definition of self-sacrifice and awesomeness.He killed his own parents,girlfriend and his clan with his own hands.He becamea a villain in the eyes of other people.He left his village,became a rogue and joined the villains not to help them but to act as a spy.He forced anger into his brother so that he would grow stronger.He ultimately suicided infront of his brother.He did get reanimated and again,this time as well,he sacrificed himself to save the world.Basically,he was just a god in my perspective.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="guy flex">
<p style="font-size:16px;">Might Guy,he was born without any chakra,i.e.,any special abilities.But with sheer hardwork and willpower,he became one of the strongest characters in the entire show.He fought with Madara Uchiha,and was declared the strongest by Madara himself.But now,he is one of the worst characters in boruto,stuck in a wheelchair after such a fierce battle.</p>

<div class="jiraiya flex">
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/6c/dc/ea/6cdcea1a287dc931cc47540da047453e.jpg">
<p style="font-size:16px;">In addition to being one of the funniest characters of the series, Jiraiya also won the hearts of fans with both his humor and role as Naruto's mentor. He called himself a big pervert, but even more than that, he was a pretty good guy at heart.As the former teacher of Minato, Naruto's father, Jiraiya built a special connection with Naruto in the absence of his father. He taught Naruto how to use Rasengan, a jutsu originally created by Minato, and guided him down the right path to saving the ninja world. His death was a painful one like Neji's, but he left a legacy behind for Naruto to carry on.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="yami flex">
<p style="font-size:16px;">Now,Yami Sukehiro from black clover.This guy is easily my second favorite character. Dude is a straight badass that doesn't take shit from anyone. Also, he is loyal as hell to julius and also he is an amazing captain. He doesn't force his squad members to do things they don't want to do but he has hope and faith in them.Asta,who was not even able to stand,was motivated sooo hard to start fighting just by a few words from Yami.I'll try to add the clip here .He is easily the best new gen sensei.</p>

<br>
<div class="light flex">
<img src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/63809.webp"></img>
<p>Light Yagami,also known as "Kira",is also one of my favorite characters.He got the deathnote which is capable of killing anyone whose name is written in it.When he got the deathnote ,this was what he said "This world is rotten, and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world... can't go on like this. I wonder... what if someone else had picked up this notebook? Is there anyone out there other than me who'd be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it: there's no one. But I can do it. In fact, I'm the only one who can. I'll do it. Using the Death Note, I'll change the world." and i completely agreed with him.He is one of the best genius and manipulators.Other honorable mentions are L Lawliet,Ayanokoji Kiyotaka and Nate River.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="baji flex">
<p style="font-size:16px;">Keisuke Baji is one of the founding members of the Tokyo Manji Gang. Baji- along with Mikey, Draken, Kazutora, Mitsuya, and Pah-Chin- started Toman. Very few people know this, but Baji was the reason why Mikey decided to create the Tokyo Manji Gang.The seemingly erratic and unpredictable Tokyo Revengers Baji turns out to be the most perceptive and intelligent of the lot as he senses the danger circling Toman and Mikey before anyone else.Even though he isnâ€™t the strongest, he fights with heart and a smirk on his face.And in the end, he took his own life to spare Kazotura all the guilt. All this to protect Mikey and the Toman.</p>

<div class="madara flex">

<p style="font-size:16px;">Madara Uchiha was one of the most badass character in all of Naruto.He was toying with the 5 kages as if they werenothing.He fought 80,000 people with special abilities like fire release,wind release,lightning release,earth release and water release.At the same time,he was fighting the 5 kages,9 tailed beasts,8 gates might guy,the 4 edo hokages and still managed to win.He was so overpowered that the creator of naruto,Masashi Kishimoto,had to create a new alien creature named Kaguys just to kill Madara.Dude was a savage beast able to summon meteors,use EMS,perfect susaanoo and also was the 10 tails jinchuriki.</p>
